OUT OF DATE
===========

I've changed the name of the project and moved all code to a new repo:

https://github.com/bitcraft/tailor

Please note, that currently the tailor repo has no stable release.  By the end of Q3, 2015,
I will have a stable release with the following changes:
- Better support for Windows OS
- More touch features
- Ability to run remote kiosk (see below)
- More template support
- Webcam image capture
