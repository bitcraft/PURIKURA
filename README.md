OUT OF DATE
===========

I've changed the name of the project and moved all code to a new repo:

https://github.com/bitcraft/tailor

Please note, that currently the tailor repo has no stable release.  By the end of Q3, 2015,
I will have a stable release with the following changes:
- Better support for Windows OS
- More touch features
- Ability to run remote kiosk (see below)
- More template support


Remote Operation
================

Currently, this project requires a dedicated PC, touch screen monitor, and an arduino.  In 
the near future, it will be possible to run the the booth with a dedicated embedded system
and a tablet touch screen PC (no apple or android...yet).

The vision is using a low cost system like the Raspberry Pi to operate the camera and printer,
while a PC tablet (like the microsoft surface x86 only, or yoga) can be used to monitor the
camera, request additional prints, change template, set up events, or do social ops like
upload to twitter or facebook.

The result will be a compact and easy-to-transport booth with a portable tablet interface.

Of course, it will still be possible to operate everything on one pc.

Gods willing, an iOS and android app will be available.
